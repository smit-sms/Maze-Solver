# Maze-Solver
This project involves implementing various search algorithms (DFS, BFS, A-Star) and Markov Decision Process (MDP) algorithms to solve mazes of varying sizes. The primary objective is to compare the performance of these algorithms based on metrics such as the time taken, the number of steps and memory consumed.
